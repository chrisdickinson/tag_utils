tag_utils is a simple library for creating template tags and blocks
for the Django templating language. It's designed around Surlex
(by Cody Soyland), and provides helper functions for creating both
template tags and blocks.

The helper functions take a function as one of the arguments, and
it's important to note that the name of that function will be the
name that's registered with django. With the parsed_block shortcut,
it will parse until it finds a tag called {% end<yourfunctionname> %}.

Installation (for testing, etc!):
$ python bootstrap.py
$ bin/buildout
